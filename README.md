# Advanced-Solution-For-Monitoring-Pesticide-Pollution-in-Fruits-and-Vegetables
**Project Title:**
Advanced Solution for Monitoring Pesticide Pollution in Fruits and Vegetables

**Abstract / Description:**
This project aims to develop a low-cost, portable, and efficient system to detect harmful levels of pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables. Leveraging embedded systems and sensor-based technology, the solution enhances food safety, supports consumer awareness, and helps reduce health risks due to toxic chemical intake.

**Objectives:**
To create a non-destructive, real-time detection system for pesticide contamination.

To raise public awareness of food safety issues.

To provide an accessible testing method for vendors, markets, and households.

**System Components:**
Arduino/ESP32 microcontroller for data processing and control.

Colorimetric or gas sensors (e.g., MQ-series, spectrophotometric sensors) to detect pesticide compounds such as organophosphates and carbamates.

UV or visible light LEDs to activate sensor responses (for chemical reaction-based detection).

OLED or LCD display to show contamination levels.

Buzzer or LED indicators for alerting the user of unsafe residue levels.

**Working Principle:**
The user places a sample near the sensor.

The sensor reacts to pesticide compounds and sends data to the microcontroller.

The system compares values against safe thresholds.

Results are displayed in real-time, indicating whether the produce is safe or contaminated.

**Key Features:**
Portable and battery-operated for field testing.

Real-time alerts for immediate decision-making.

User-friendly interface for use in rural and urban settings.

Scalable and cost-effective for wide deployment in local markets and farms.

**Impact:**
Empowers consumers and vendors to test produce quality.

Encourages reduced pesticide usage in agriculture.

Supports public health initiatives by preventing toxic exposure.
